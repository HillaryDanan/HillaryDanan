## Empirical AI Cognitive Architecture Research | Neuroscience PhD

I develop frameworks to empirically measure how AI models process information and reflect on their own cognition, applying methods validated through 60+ fMRI sessions including resting-state analysis of neurodiversity.

## 🔬 Research Innovation

**First empirical framework combining:**
- **Quantitative architecture mapping** (TIDE-analysis) - like task-based fMRI
- **Metacognitive perception studies** (TIDE-resonance) - like resting-state fMRI

When AI models describe visualizations and reflect on their processing, they exhibit patterns analogous to Default Mode Network activation - providing an empirical window into AI metacognition.

### 📊 Latest Findings
**21 sessions | 630 responses | p < 0.0001**

| Model | Coherence | 95% CI | Architecture Type |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Gemini 1.5 Flash | **71.5%** | [63.1%, 79.8%] | Most neurotypical-like |
| Claude 3 Haiku | **55.1%** | [51.7%, 58.4%] | Balanced processing |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | **38.3%** | [35.9%, 40.7%] | Most neurodivergent-like |

## 📈 Research Applications

### For AI Safety & Alignment
Empirical measurement of cognitive architectures provides data for understanding AI behavior patterns. The metacognitive analysis reveals how models conceptualize their own processing.

### For Neuroscience-AI Collaboration
These frameworks bridge resting-state fMRI methods with AI analysis, enabling novel investigations into machine consciousness and self-awareness.

### For Model Development
Understanding architectural diversity informs the design of more robust, interpretable AI systems with measurable cognitive profiles.
