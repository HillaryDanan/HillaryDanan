## 🔬 Current Focus

**Bridging neuroscience and AI through empirical analysis**

My PhD research discovered that human brains achieve identical outcomes through diverse neural pathways. I now apply these validated methods to measure analogous patterns in AI systems, creating tools for:

- **Empirical measurement** of AI processing patterns
- **Automated analysis** across multiple models simultaneously  
- **3D visualization** of architectural differences
- **Standardized comparison** using neuroscience-validated metrics

### ⚡ Latest: TIDE-analysis
Built an automated framework in 1 day that empirically tests how different AI models process identical inputs. [Explore the tool →](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE-analysis)
