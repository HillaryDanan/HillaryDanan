## 🧠 Research Vision

*"Different minds resonate with different rhythms - let's map the spectrum"*

Exploring how cognitive diversity creates computational advantages through mathematical frameworks and interactive visualizations. This living portfolio represents ongoing experimental work in AI interpretability and cognitive modeling.

**Core Thesis:** Different minds may achieve similar outcomes through different dimensional organizations of self and time. By exploring these patterns mathematically, we could build AI systems that leverage cognitive diversity for robustness, adaptability, and innovation.

### 📝 A Note on Cognitive Diversity

Throughout my work, I use terms like "neurotypical," "ASD," and "ADHD" as communication tools, not rigid categories. These labels describe **tendencies, not destinies** - they represent different valid ways of processing information, not deficits or disorders. 

As I explain in my [full disclaimer](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md): *"When I say 'ASD-TIDE,' I'm not talking about a disorder. I'm talking about a systematic, pattern-based approach to cognition that happens to align with patterns often seen in autistic individuals. It's a cognitive style that our world desperately needs."*

**The TIDE Philosophy:** Cognitive patterns are dynamic, not fixed. Everyone uses different strategies in different contexts. The goal is understanding, not categorization.

## 🔬 Active Research Study

### **AI Perceptual Signatures Study** 
*Generating unique data on how different AI models perceive complex systems*

We're conducting the first systematic study of how different AI models perceive and describe the same complex visualization - revealing cognitive diversity in AI systems.

## 🌟 Featured: TIDE-Resonance

Interactive exploration of how different cognitive architectures build trust through shared experiences. The framework models three cognitive patterns (labeled NT/ASD/ADHD for communication purposes) as equally valid information processing strategies, each with unique strengths.

## 📊 Portfolio Stats

- **12+** Interactive Research Tools (and counting)
- **Initial Sprint:** November 2024 (4 weeks)
- **Status:** Actively developing - this is a living portfolio
- **Latest Addition:** AI Perception Study
- **Currently Building:** Cross-model resonance patterns

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Dimensional Reorganization:** What appears as "deficit" may be efficient reorganization
2. **Trust Dynamics:** Different architectures may build trust through different pathways  
3. **Sensory Resonance:** Each architecture potentially resonates with different environmental patterns
4. **Complementary Processing:** Diverse teams may outperform homogeneous ones

*These insights reframe cognitive differences as architectural variations - like different operating systems that excel at different tasks.*
