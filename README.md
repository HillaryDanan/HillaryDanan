## üß† Current Research

I'm exploring how neurodiversity insights can create more robust AI systems through cognitive architectural diversity.

### üöÄ Recent Work: Cognitive Architectures for AI

Over 3 weeks, I developed a 7-repository research program bridging empirical neuroscience to practical AI applications:

- **[TIDE](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE)** - Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding framework
- **[BIND](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/BIND)** - Boundary Information Neural Dynamics
- **[Concrete-Overflow-Detector](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector)** - Alternative neural pathway detection
- **[Information-Atoms](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/information-atoms)** - Discrete information processing units
- **[Hexagonal-Consciousness Suite](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/hexagonal-consciousness-suite)** - Cognitive organization patterns
- **[Hexagonal-Vision Research](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/hexagonal-vision-research)** - Visual processing architectures
- **[Game-Theory-Trust Suite](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/game-theory-trust-suite)** - Architecture-specific cooperation

## üìä Background

- **Cognitive Neuroscience PhD** (2021) - Neural representation of abstract concepts
- **4+ Years** - Data Science in production environments
- **Research Focus** - How different minds achieve identical outcomes through alternative pathways

## üéØ Core Insight

*"Cognitive diversity is not a bug to be fixed, but a feature to be understood and leveraged."*

My research shows that what we call "neurodivergent" processing often represents alternative computational strategies that could make AI systems more robust.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python, R, JavaScript
- **ML/AI**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Neuroscience**: fMRI analysis, computational modeling
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Plotly, matplotlib
